<h1>Friends Noonsong – Technical Write-up</h1>
<h2>Unity Client | Team Project</h2>
<hr />

<p>
This page provides a deeper explanation of the key technical challenges I handled
in the project, focusing on system integration and problem-solving.
</p>

<h2>1. Integrating GPS-based Spawn System with AR Collection</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
The project already had a GPS-based spawn system implemented by a teammate.
Objects were spawned based on building areas, while AR collection and the
collection system were developed separately.
Integrating these independent systems into a single gameplay flow was the main challenge.
</p>

<h3>Understanding the Existing Spawn Logic</h3>
<p>
Buildings were divided into rectangular zones.
When the player entered a zone, the corresponding spawn script became active
and spawned objects specific to that building.
Each character was defined as a ScriptableObject with metadata, including its spawn location.
</p>

<h3>My Role</h3>
<p>
I analyzed the existing spawn logic and added interfaces needed for integration:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added a function to return the current building name when entering a zone</li>
  <li>Implemented filtering logic to retrieve spawnable characters based on building name</li>
  <li>Connected spawn data with AR collection and the collection system</li>
</ul>

<h3>Core Problem</h3>
<p>
Although objects were spawning correctly, multiple issues appeared during AR interaction:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Objects visible on screen could not be collected</li>
  <li>Collected objects were added to the collection but remained in the world</li>
  <li>Duplicate spawns occurred due to timing mismatches</li>
  <li>Incorrect scale or rotation in AR view</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>
To stabilize the integration, I focused on unifying interaction and state handling:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Introduced screen-visibility-based targeting for AR collection</li>
  <li>Mapped spawned GameObjects directly to their data entries</li>
  <li>Standardized the collection flow (collect → register → remove → update UI)</li>
  <li>Added destruction checks to prevent duplicate spawns</li>
</ul>

<h3>Result</h3>
<p>
The spawn, AR collection, and collection systems were successfully unified into
a single, stable gameplay flow.
This significantly improved AR interaction reliability and reduced state-related bugs.
</p>

<h2>2. Stabilizing AR Collection After Beta Test</h2>

<h3>Issues Found During Beta</h3>
<p>
After the beta release, several issues were reported during real-world usage:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Objects appeared on screen but were not collectible</li>
  <li>Duplicate objects appeared after respawn cycles</li>
  <li>Collection state and world state became inconsistent</li>
</ul>

<h3>Root Cause</h3>
<p>
The core issue was that multiple systems managed object state independently,
which caused inconsistencies in AR environments.
</p>

<h3>Fixes Applied</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Unified collection target management</li>
  <li>Fixed the order of collection processing</li>
  <li>Improved spawn cleanup logic during respawn intervals</li>
</ul>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>
AR collection became more stable, and duplicate or inconsistent states were eliminated.
The fixes significantly improved the overall user experience during gameplay.
